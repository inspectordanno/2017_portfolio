                  <p class="card-text">This was the first website I made from scratch, ever! My Dad
                  runs a business about Philadelphia nostaglia, and I needed to develop a website.
                Could the stars have aligned any better?</p>

                <p class="card-text">I realize now that I could have made some better design choices. For example,
                there is no coherence in the typography. Also, there is no color scheme. When I have a break in classes,
                I will revisit this site and improve it with my new design knowledge! I am proud of the website, however. I think
                it has a simple information architecture and conveys what my Dad does very fluently.
