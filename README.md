## This is my 2017 portfolio. 
I coded it from scratch, with some help from a tutorial. It was a learning experience, but became quite unsustainable. There wasn't any preprocessing, so to add new content, I had to copy all my HTML into additional files. I switched to a Jekyll workflow for my 2018 portfolio in the hopes of mitigating these problems.
